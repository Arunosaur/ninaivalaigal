echo "====================================="

echo "🔑 Global Admin (role: 'admin'):"
echo "  ✅ Can access all teams"
echo "  ✅ Can perform all operations"
echo "  ✅ Can override team permissions"

echo "🎯 Step 6: Complete Workflow Example"
echo "===================================="

echo "1. Admin creates team:"

echo "4. Team member views team:"
echo "   curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN' \\"

echo "✅ Team Management System Ready!"
echo "==============================="
echo ""
echo "🎉 Features Available:"
echo "  ✅ Team creation (admin only)"
echo "  ✅ Member management (add/remove)"
echo "  ✅ Role management (promote/demote)"
echo "  ✅ Permission enforcement"
echo "  ✅ Team listing and viewing"
echo ""
echo "🔗 Integration Points:"
echo "  🧠 Memory contexts can be scoped to teams"
echo "  📁 Team-specific contexts and approvals"
echo "  🔐 JWT-based authentication throughout"
echo ""
echo "📚 Next Steps:"
echo "  1. Connect to real database"
echo "  2. Add email notifications"
echo "  3. Build frontend interface"
echo "  4. Integrate with memory system"
