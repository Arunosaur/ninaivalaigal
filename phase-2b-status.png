# Phase 2B Status Visualization
# This would be a status dashboard image showing:
# - All 5 components completed (green checkmarks)
# - Performance metrics achieved
# - Integration flow diagram
# - Recovery system architecture
# - Monitoring dashboard preview

# Since we can't generate actual images, this file serves as a placeholder
# for the Phase 2B status visualization that would show:
