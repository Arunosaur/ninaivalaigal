# SPEC-050: Cross-Organizational Memory Sharing System

## Status: ✅ DRAFT COMPLETE

## Objective:
Enable controlled and auditable sharing of memory tokens across organizational boundaries, while preserving isolation, compliance, and ownership integrity.

## Use Cases:
- 🤝 Partner organizations sharing common intelligence
- 🏫 Educators across micro-schools sharing learning modules
- 🧠 Cross-pod AI context sharing without full access

## Key Features:
- 🔐 Org-to-Org Token Bridge: Share memory access between trusted orgs
- 🔍 Visibility Scopes: `EXTERNAL-READ`, `EXTERNAL-REFERENCE`, `EXTERNAL-EMBED`
- 📎 Shared Link Tokens: With domain+token-based verification
- 📄 Sharing Policy Framework: Org-level allow/deny filters
- 🧾 Audit Ledger: Timestamped and signed memory bridge access logs

## Implementation:
- OrgID-aware ACL logic in SPEC-043
- Secure token handshake for cross-org access
- Inter-org trust model in memory context pipeline

## Safeguards:
- 🚧 Sandbox Mode: View-only rendering for sensitive tokens
- 🚨 Compliance Tags: Block sharing of flagged memory categories
- ✅ Verification Headers: Each org signs outbound token sharing via internal key

## Future Enhancements:
- Federation of search across orgs
- Federated AI preloading via cross-org memory broker
