# SPEC-062: GraphOps Stack Deployment Architecture

## üéØ Purpose
To formalize the architecture, containerization, and operational separation of the **GraphOps Stack** responsible for graph intelligence in the `ninaivalaigal` platform. This includes Apache AGE integration, REST API endpoints for reasoning, Redis-backed performance, and testable deployment as an independent service.

---

## üß† Background

Graph intelligence features (SPEC-060 and SPEC-061) have been implemented to:
- Enhance memory context through graph traversal and inference
- Serve AI agents with relevance-ranked, explainable paths
- Enable adaptive learning via feedback

This SPEC defines the deployment architecture for running these graph features **independently from the core app stack**, to ensure:
- **Separation of concerns**
- **Independent scaling**
- **Experimental freedom** without affecting core user operations

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Main Stack (Existing)
- **DB**: `nv-db` (PostgreSQL 15 + pgvector)
- **Purpose**: Core application and memory tokens
- **Port**: `5432`

### GraphOps Stack (NEW - IMPLEMENTED)
- **DB**: `ninaivalaigal-graph-db` (PostgreSQL 15 + Apache AGE v1.5.0-rc0)
- **Purpose**: Graph intelligence (reasoning, ranking, explanations)
- **Port**: `5433`
- **Redis**: `ninaivalaigal-graph-redis` (Redis 7-alpine)
- **Port**: `6380`

---

## üì¶ Containerization Strategy

### Dual-Architecture Support
Following our proven dual-architecture strategy:

#### üçé ARM64 (Apple Container CLI - Local Development)
- **Native ARM64 performance** with 3-5x faster container startup
- **Apple Container CLI** commands for optimal developer experience
- **No emulation overhead** on Apple Silicon

#### üè≠ x86_64 (Docker - CI/Production)
- **GitHub Actions CI** validation with `docker-compose.graph.ci.yml`
- **Production deployment** compatibility
- **Multi-cloud support** for enterprise scaling

### Services
- `ninaivalaigal-graph-db`: PostgreSQL 15 with Apache AGE extension
- `ninaivalaigal-graph-redis`: Redis for TTL-based performance cache
- `graphops-api` (Future): FastAPI app exposing `/graph/*` endpoints

### Volumes
- `graph_data`: PostgreSQL data persistence
- `graph_redis_data`: Redis data persistence

### Networking
- Dedicated network: `ninaivalaigal-network`
- Internal service discovery via container names

### Port Mappings
- `5434` : PostgreSQL (Apache AGE)
- `8081` : FastAPI endpoints (Future)
- `6381` : Redis cache
