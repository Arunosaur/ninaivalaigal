# Feature Specification: Multi-User Authentication & Authorization

**Feature Branch**: `002-multi-user-authentication`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Input**: Secure multi-user system with JWT authentication, role-based permissions, and user isolation

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a team lead, I need a secure authentication system that allows multiple users to access the memory system with proper isolation, so that team members can collaborate on shared contexts while keeping personal contexts private.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I register with valid credentials, **Then** I can login and access the system
2. **Given** I am authenticated, **When** I create a context, **Then** only I can access it unless explicitly shared
3. **Given** multiple users are active, **When** each user creates memories, **Then** users cannot see each other's private data
4. **Given** I logout, **When** I try to access protected resources, **Then** access is denied until re-authentication

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JWT tokens expire during active sessions?
- How does system handle concurrent login attempts with same credentials?
- What occurs when user tries to access another user's private context?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide user registration with username, password, and email
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate users via JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- **FR-003**: System MUST hash passwords using cryptographically secure methods
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide user isolation - no cross-user data access
- **FR-005**: System MUST support login/logout functionality with token management
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate JWT tokens on all protected endpoints
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent environment variable spoofing for user identification
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain audit trail of authentication events
- **FR-010**: System MUST support token refresh and secure session management

### Key Entities
- **User**: Authenticated entity with unique credentials and profile information
- **JWT Token**: Time-limited authentication credential with user claims
- **Role**: Permission level defining what actions a user can perform
- **Session**: Active authenticated user session with token and metadata
