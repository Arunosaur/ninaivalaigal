# SPEC-045: Memory Export + Import + Merge

## 📌 Overview
This SPEC enables users and teams to export their memory data, import external memory tokens, and perform intelligent merges with conflict resolution and deduplication.

## 🎯 Goals
- Support full and partial memory export/import (JSON or encrypted format)
- Provide merge logic to deduplicate and resolve conflicts
- Enable use cases such as backup, transfer, or multi-source aggregation

## 🔍 Features
- Export Formats: Raw JSON, Encrypted ZIP, Tokenized Streams
- Import Workflow: Validate schema, transform if needed, review diff
- Merge Engine:
  - Conflict Detection (timestamp, similarity, relevance score)
  - Deduplication Logic (hash-based or content-similarity)
  - Manual Merge Override Option
- UI and CLI support for export/import/merge

## 🏗️ Implementation Components
- `mem export` / `mem import` / `mem merge` CLI commands
- `merge_engine.py`: core merge logic with scoring and audit logging
- `exporter.py`: handles streaming/export formats (supports large sets)
- `import_validator.py`: pre-process and validate external tokens
- `merge_ui`: optional React component for visual conflict resolution

## 🔐 Security
- Encrypted export (AES-256 or user PGP)
- All imports are staged before merge (quarantine zone)
- Access logs for export/import operations

## 🔗 Dependencies
- SPEC-031: Relevance Score (used in merge decisions)
- SPEC-029: Audit Logging (log all export/import/merge activity)
