# SPEC-063: Agentic Core Execution Framework

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: Critical
**Category**: AI Intelligence

## Overview

AI agent orchestration and execution framework with multiple execution modes, intent routing, and context-aware decision making for autonomous AI operations.

## Implementation

### Execution Modes
- **Synchronous Mode**: Direct request-response processing
- **Asynchronous Mode**: Background task execution with callbacks
- **Streaming Mode**: Real-time response streaming for long operations
- **Batch Mode**: Bulk processing with progress tracking
- **Interactive Mode**: Multi-turn conversation handling
- **Autonomous Mode**: Self-directed task execution
- **Collaborative Mode**: Multi-agent coordination

### Intent Routing
- **Intent Classification**: Natural language intent detection
- **Context Injection**: Dynamic context based on user and session
- **Route Selection**: Optimal execution path determination
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation for unknown intents

### Agent Capabilities
- **Memory Access**: Intelligent memory retrieval and storage
- **Graph Reasoning**: Multi-hop relationship traversal
- **Context Awareness**: Dynamic context injection and management
- **Learning**: Adaptive behavior based on interaction patterns

### Technical Architecture
- **Agent Registry**: Dynamic agent discovery and registration
- **Execution Engine**: Multi-threaded task processing
- **State Management**: Persistent agent state and session handling
- **Monitoring**: Real-time agent performance and health tracking

## Features

- **7 Execution Modes**: Comprehensive execution strategy coverage
- **Intent Routing**: Intelligent request classification and routing
- **Context Injection**: Dynamic context based on user/session state
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time execution metrics and optimization

## Status

✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - Operational with genuine AI intelligence capabilities
