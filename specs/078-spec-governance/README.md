# SPEC-078: SPEC Governance

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Meta-Process

## Overview

Meta-governance system for managing the SPEC lifecycle, ensuring consistency, tracking dependencies, and maintaining quality across all specifications. This system provides the framework for sustainable SPEC management at scale.

## Key Features

- **SPEC Lifecycle Management**: Creation, review, approval, implementation, retirement
- **Dependency Tracking**: Automatic detection and management of SPEC relationships
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation, consistency checks, and standards enforcement
- **Version Control**: SPEC versioning, change tracking, and rollback capabilities
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessment of changes across dependent SPECs
- **Automated Reporting**: Status dashboards, progress tracking, and analytics
- **Template System**: Standardized SPEC templates and formatting

## Implementation Goals

1. **Standardize Process**: Establish consistent SPEC creation and management workflows
2. **Automate Validation**: Reduce manual overhead through automation
3. **Improve Visibility**: Provide clear status tracking and reporting
4. **Enable Scaling**: Support growing number of SPECs and contributors
5. **Ensure Quality**: Maintain high standards across all specifications

## Governance Framework

### SPEC States
- **DRAFT**: Initial creation and development
- **REVIEW**: Peer review and validation phase
- **APPROVED**: Ready for implementation
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Active implementation
- **COMPLETE**: Implementation finished and validated
- **DEPRECATED**: Superseded or no longer relevant

### Review Process
- **Technical Review**: Architecture and implementation feasibility
- **Dependency Analysis**: Impact on existing SPECs
- **Resource Assessment**: Implementation effort and timeline
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Business and technical sign-off

### Quality Gates
- **Completeness**: All required sections present
- **Consistency**: Alignment with existing standards
- **Feasibility**: Technical and resource viability
- **Dependencies**: Proper relationship mapping

## Technical Implementation

- **SPEC Parser**: Automated analysis of SPEC documents
- **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation of SPEC relationships
- **Validation Engine**: Automated quality and consistency checks
- **Dashboard System**: Real-time status and progress tracking
- **Notification System**: Automated alerts for status changes

## Dependencies

- **SPEC_AUDIT_2024.md**: Current tracking document (foundation)
- **SPEC-058**: Documentation Expansion (documentation standards)
- **SPEC-070**: Real-time Monitoring Dashboard (status visualization)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% SPEC compliance with governance standards
- [ ] <24-hour review cycle for standard SPECs
- [ ] Automated dependency conflict detection
- [ ] Real-time status tracking for all SPECs
- [ ] 50% reduction in SPEC management overhead
