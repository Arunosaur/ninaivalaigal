# SPEC-051: Platform Stability & Developer Experience

**Title:** Comprehensive Platform Stability, Technical Debt Management & Developer Experience Enhancement
**Status:** DRAFT
**Created On:** 2025-09-21
**Category:** Platform Stability, Maintenance & Developer Experience
**Author:** ninaivalaigal/core
**Related SPECs:** SPEC-033, SPEC-040, SPEC-043, SPEC-045

## 🎯 Purpose

To create a comprehensive system that addresses both platform stability through centralized issue tracking AND developer experience through improved development workflows.

This SPEC ensures:
1. **Platform Stability**: All known issues are formally documented and prioritized
2. **Developer Experience**: Development friction is minimized through improved tooling
3. **Code Quality**: Consistent standards without hampering productivity

---

## 🔧 PART A: Technical Debt & Bug Tracking

### Objective
Centralized mechanism to track unresolved bugs, edge cases, technical debt items, and deferred implementation issues across the ninaivalaigal platform.

---

## 🛠️ Issues Currently Tracked

### 1. ⚠️ OpenAPI Schema Generation Issue

- **Description:**
  FastAPI routers have malformed endpoint definitions that break OpenAPI generation.
  The `/openapi.json` endpoint returns `Content-Length: 86638` but sends 0 bytes, causing:
  ```
  h11.LocalProtocolError: Too little data for declared Content-Length
  ```

- **Impact:**
  - `docs` and `/openapi.json` inaccessible
  - Cannot introspect endpoints programmatically
  - All core functionality unaffected

- **Resolution Ideas:**
  - Systematically test routers one-by-one
  - Validate all endpoint response models
  - Review any custom middleware

---

### 2. ⚠️ SPEC-043 `/system-status` Content-Length Issue

- **Description:**
  Minor issue with the `/system-status` endpoint returning invalid content-length headers.

- **Impact:**
  - Non-critical endpoint
  - All business logic and ACL operations work perfectly

- **Resolution Ideas:**
  - Adjust endpoint headers or response return method
  - Validate response stream length consistency

---

## 🚀 PART B: Pre-Commit Resilience & Developer Experience

### Objective
Enhance developer productivity and code quality by reducing friction caused by frequent pre-commit hook failures due to code formatting issues.

### Problem Statement
- Developers experience repeated pre-commit failures due to minor formatting violations (e.g., `black`, `ruff`, `isort`)
- The process of reformatting and recommitting creates frustration and delays
- Lack of automated fixes or clear messaging compounds the issue

### Proposed Solutions

#### Option A: Auto-Fix on Commit
- Enable `--fix` mode in tools like:
  - `ruff --fix`
  - `black`
  - `isort`
- Allow commits to proceed with warnings for non-critical issues

#### Option B: Pre-Commit Feedback Assistant
- Add CLI command `make lint-explain` to provide:
  - Human-readable descriptions of what failed
  - Fix suggestions and previews
- Output formatting diff logs to `logs/lint/`

#### Option C: CI Preformatting Layer
- GitHub Actions auto-format PR code and push fixes
- Optionally enforce stricter checks only on `main`, `release`, or protected branches

### Strategic Benefits
- Boost developer confidence and onboarding ease
- Lower commit latency and mental overhead
- Preserve formatting quality while minimizing disruption

---

## 🔁 Future Expansion

This SPEC may be expanded to include:

### Technical Debt Management:
- Feature flag tracking
- API deprecation schedules
- Known performance bottlenecks
- Dev backlog items for future sprints

### Developer Experience:
- IDE integration improvements
- Automated code quality metrics
- Developer onboarding automation
- Performance profiling tools

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Part A: Technical Debt Tracking
- A formal markdown log for each tracked issue
- Linked PRs or commits resolving each issue
- Summary table of open vs resolved issues

### Part B: Developer Experience
- Reduced pre-commit failure rate by 80%
- Average commit time reduced by 50%
- Developer satisfaction survey improvements
- Automated fix success rate >90%
