# SPEC-063: Agentic Core Execution Framework

## 🧠 Summary

The Agentic Core Execution Framework is designed to dynamically route, orchestrate, and execute intelligent operations based on memory context, user prompts, and domain-specific logic. It serves as the core "decision engine" that interprets user intent and coordinates interaction between subsystems (memory, AI, database, agents, etc.).

## 🎯 Goals

- Design a modular execution engine for dynamic memory-driven reasoning
- Define execution contexts (e.g., inference, search, summarization, analytics)
- Plug in intelligent agents that operate based on context and feedback
- Support fine-grained control over tool usage, memory injection, and AI alignment
- Enable extensible intent/action routing (agentic mediation)

## 🧱 Components

### 1. `agent_core.py`
- Central routing mechanism for execution logic
- Maintains execution state (user, memory context, toolchain)

### 2. `intention_router.py`
- Detects execution *intent* (e.g., "summarize", "search", "analyze", "generate")
- Routes to corresponding micro-agent chain

### 3. `execution_context.py`
- Captures contextual data (user, memory, permissions, environment)
- Serializable and auditable for tracing and replay

### 4. Toolchain Integration
- Interfaces with AI models (OpenAI, Claude, local LLMs)
- Injects memory tokens and guardrails for scoped AI output
- Optional: DataFrame ops, SQL generation, chain-of-thought tracing

## 📊 Metrics & Observability

- Track agent decisions, fallback paths, failure modes
- Execution latency, tool usage patterns, and memory recall success rate

## 🔍 Test Strategy

- Unit tests for router, context, and agent logic
- Integration tests for dynamic agent chaining
- Benchmarks for common execution paths (summarize, extract, analyze)

## 🚧 Open Questions

- How do we sandbox agent execution to avoid runaway resource use?
- Should we allow agent chaining or restrict to fixed logic?
- How do we surface *why* a decision was made (agent explainability)?

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Executable intent-routing engine with at least 3 working execution modes
- AI tools scoped by context with memory + user-based injection
- Logs and metrics for all execution paths
