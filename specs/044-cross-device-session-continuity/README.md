# SPEC-044: Cross-Device Memory Session Continuity

## 📌 Overview
This SPEC enables memory continuity across multiple user devices (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet). It ensures seamless session handover and sync of active memory tokens.

## 🎯 Goals
- Preserve active memory context when switching devices.
- Allow "handoff" or "resume session" capability via sync token.
- Maintain in-progress memory logs securely and consistently.

## 🔍 Features
- Session Token Hand-off (encrypted context payload)
- Memory Context Replay: Resume open memory chain on new device
- Background Sync on All Devices (low-interval polling or push)
- Device-Aware Session Management Dashboard (View and revoke devices)
- Token Expiry & Auto-Logout Handling across devices

## 🏗️ Implementation
- Device Registration: Associate device IDs with session tokens
- Memory Context Serializer: Convert current context to resumable payload
- Sync Engine: Cross-device memory pull + context rehydration
- WebSocket or Polling Support (client-dependent)

## 🔐 Security
- Per-device session tokens with optional MFA
- Logout on one device invalidates others (configurable)
- Context encryption for hand-off to prevent tampering

## 🔗 Dependencies
- SPEC-032: Session Scoping
- SPEC-031: Relevance Scoring (can aid in handoff token prioritization)
- SPEC-040: Feedback Loop (preserve feedback trail per device)
