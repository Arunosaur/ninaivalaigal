# SPEC-042: Memory Synchronization Between Users and Teams

## 📌 Overview
This SPEC outlines a mechanism to synchronize memory tokens between users and teams for collaborative projects. It supports push/pull updates, conflict resolution, and memory history tracking.

## 🎯 Goals
- Enable collaborative memory sharing with automatic sync across users or teams.
- Ensure consistent view of shared memory states.
- Provide fine-grained control over sync frequency and conflict policies.

## 🔍 Features
- Manual and Auto Sync Modes
- Memory Push/Pull Controls per team or user
- Timestamp-based Conflict Resolution
- Versioning: Keep track of memory history and revisions
- Event Log: Record sync activities for audit and debug
- Sync Permissions: Only admins or authors can push by default

## 🧱 Components
- `sync_manager.py`: Core sync logic for push/pull
- `memory_versions.py`: Track edit history and diffs
- `sync_cron.py`: Optional periodic sync trigger for teams
- CLI Commands: `mem sync --team`, `mem pull`, `mem diff`

## 🔐 Security & Controls
- Shared memory cannot overwrite private tokens without explicit consent.
- Sync logs include user identity and timestamp.
- Token-scoped sync (SPEC-030) restricts unauthorized replication.

## 🔗 Dependencies
- SPEC-014: RBAC Controls
- SPEC-017: Memory Collections
- SPEC-030: Token Scoping
