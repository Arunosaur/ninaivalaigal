# Feature Specification: Team Collaboration & Context Sharing

**Feature Branch**: `004-team-collaboration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Input**: Multi-level sharing system with organizations, teams, and granular permissions for collaborative development

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I need to share contexts and memories with my teammates while maintaining control over personal work, so that we can collaborate effectively on shared projects while preserving individual privacy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I create a team context, **When** I share it with team members, **Then** they can view and contribute to shared memories
2. **Given** I have personal contexts, **When** teammates try to access them, **Then** access is denied unless explicitly shared
3. **Given** multiple permission levels exist, **When** users interact with shared contexts, **Then** actions are restricted based on their permission level
4. **Given** organization-wide contexts exist, **When** new team members join, **Then** they automatically get appropriate access

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user leaves organization but has shared contexts?
- How does system handle permission conflicts between team and organization levels?
- What occurs when context owner transfers ownership to another user?

## Requirements
