# Feature Specification: VS Code IDE Integration

**Feature Branch**: `005-vs-code-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Input**: VS Code extension with chat participant for memory recall and context management within IDE

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer using VS Code, I need integrated access to my memory system directly within the IDE, so that I can recall project context and store development insights without leaving my coding environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** VS Code extension is installed, **When** I use @mem0 chat participant, **Then** I can interact with memory system from IDE
2. **Given** I'm working in a workspace, **When** I recall memories, **Then** extension automatically uses workspace name as context
3. **Given** I switch between projects, **When** I recall memories, **Then** each workspace maintains separate context isolation
4. **Given** I store memories via extension, **When** I recall them later, **Then** memories are properly associated with current workspace

### Edge Cases
- What happens when VS Code workspace has no folder name?
- How does extension handle memory system server being offline?
- What occurs when multiple VS Code instances access same context simultaneously?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Extension MUST provide @mem0 chat participant for memory interactions
- **FR-002**: Extension MUST automatically detect workspace context for memory operations
- **FR-003**: Extension MUST support memory recall filtered by workspace context
- **FR-004**: Extension MUST allow manual memory storage from IDE
- **FR-005**: Extension MUST provide context switching capabilities within IDE
- **FR-006**: Extension MUST maintain persistent context state across IDE sessions
- **FR-007**: Extension MUST handle memory system connectivity gracefully
- **FR-008**: Extension MUST provide debug logging for troubleshooting
- **FR-009**: Extension MUST integrate with existing CLI commands and server API
- **FR-010**: Extension MUST support multiple workspace configurations

### Key Entities
- **Chat Participant**: VS Code interface for memory system interactions
- **Workspace Context**: IDE workspace mapped to memory context
- **Extension State**: Persistent configuration and context information
- **Memory Command**: IDE command that translates to memory system operations
