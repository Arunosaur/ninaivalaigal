# Feature Specification: Core Memory System

**Feature Branch**: `001-core-memory-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Input**: Universal memory layer for AI agents with context-aware command capture and recall

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with AI agents, I need a system that automatically captures my terminal commands and allows me to recall them by context, so that AI agents can maintain persistent memory of my development sessions and provide better assistance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I start a recording context, **When** I run terminal commands, **Then** commands are automatically captured to that context
2. **Given** I have captured commands in a context, **When** I recall from that context, **Then** I see only commands from that specific context
3. **Given** I stop recording, **When** I run commands, **Then** no commands are captured (camera off protection)
4. **Given** I have multiple contexts, **When** I switch between them, **Then** each context maintains separate command histories

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no context is active but commands are executed?
- How does system handle context switching during active command execution?
- What occurs when storage fails during command capture?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST capture terminal commands automatically when recording context is active
- **FR-002**: System MUST store commands with metadata (timestamp, exit code, working directory, context)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide context isolation - commands only visible within their context
- **FR-004**: System MUST support starting/stopping recording contexts
- **FR-005**: System MUST block command capture when no context is active ("camera off")
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow manual memory storage via CLI commands
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide recall functionality filtered by context
- **FR-008**: System MUST support multiple concurrent contexts per user
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist memories across system restarts
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide shell integration for automatic capture

### Key Entities
- **Context**: Named recording session that groups related commands and memories
- **Memory**: Individual captured command or manually stored data with metadata
- **User**: Entity that owns contexts and memories (for multi-user scenarios)
