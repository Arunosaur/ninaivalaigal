# SPEC-081: Proactive Memory Alert Layer

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Intelligence & Automation

## Overview

Intelligent notification system that proactively surfaces relevant memories and insights based on context, patterns, and predictive analysis. This layer transforms passive memory storage into an active intelligence partner that anticipates user needs.

## Key Features

- **Contextual Awareness**: Real-time context analysis for relevant memory surfacing
- **Predictive Alerts**: ML-driven prediction of when memories will be needed
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detection of recurring situations and memory usage patterns
- **Smart Timing**: Optimal notification delivery based on user behavior and preferences
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Notifications via web, mobile, email, and integrations
- **Priority Intelligence**: Automatic prioritization based on urgency and importance
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous improvement based on user feedback and interactions

## Implementation Goals

1. **Proactive Intelligence**: Surface relevant information before users need to search
2. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Minimize mental effort required to recall important information
3. **Improve Decision Making**: Provide timely context for better decisions
4. **Increase Productivity**: Reduce time spent searching for relevant memories
5. **Enhance User Experience**: Create a truly intelligent, helpful memory assistant
