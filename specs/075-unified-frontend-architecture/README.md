# SPEC-075: Unified Frontend Architecture

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Frontend Architecture

## Overview

Modern React+D3 unified architecture that consolidates all frontend components into a cohesive, maintainable system. This SPEC defines the architectural patterns, component libraries, and integration strategies for a unified frontend experience.

## Key Features

- **Unified Component Library**: Standardized React components across all interfaces
- **D3 Integration**: Seamless data visualization capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, adaptive layouts
- **State Management**: Centralized state with Redux/Zustand
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, caching strategies
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E testing

## Implementation Goals

1. **Consolidate UI Components**: Merge scattered UI elements into unified library
2. **Standardize Patterns**: Establish consistent design patterns and conventions
3. **Optimize Performance**: Implement advanced optimization techniques
4. **Enable Scalability**: Architecture that supports future growth
5. **Improve Developer Experience**: Better tooling, documentation, and workflows

## Dependencies

- **SPEC-068**: Comprehensive UI Suite (foundation)
- **SPEC-070**: Real-time Monitoring Dashboard (integration target)
- **SPEC-076**: Visual Narrative Layer (UI framework consumer)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Unified component library with 95% reusability
- [ ] Sub-2-second initial load times
- [ ] 100% accessibility compliance
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Developer onboarding time reduced by 50%
