# SPEC-080: Trust Score System for Memories

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Memory Intelligence

## Overview

Advanced trust and reliability scoring system for memory data that evaluates the credibility, accuracy, and reliability of stored memories. This system helps users make informed decisions based on memory quality and trustworthiness metrics.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Factor Trust Scoring**: Comprehensive evaluation using multiple trust indicators
- **Source Credibility Analysis**: Assessment of memory origin and provenance
- **Temporal Decay Modeling**: Trust degradation over time with configurable parameters
- **Cross-Validation**: Verification against multiple sources and references
- **User Feedback Integration**: Community-driven trust validation
- **Automated Fact-Checking**: Integration with external verification services
- **Trust Visualization**: Clear, intuitive trust indicators in the UI

## Implementation Goals

1. **Enhance Decision Making**: Provide reliable trust indicators for memory-based decisions
2. **Prevent Misinformation**: Identify and flag potentially unreliable memories
3. **Build User Confidence**: Increase trust in the memory system through transparency
4. **Enable Quality Control**: Systematic approach to memory quality management
5. **Support Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data reliability

## Trust Scoring Factors

### Source Reliability (30%)
- Origin verification and authentication
- Historical accuracy of the source
- Reputation and credibility metrics
- Verification status and certificates

### Content Analysis (25%)
- Internal consistency checks
- Factual accuracy validation
- Completeness and detail level
- Logical coherence assessment

### Temporal Factors (20%)
- Recency and freshness of information
- Time-based decay calculations
- Update frequency and maintenance
- Historical accuracy tracking

### Cross-Validation (15%)
- Corroboration with other memories
- External source verification
- Consensus analysis across sources
- Conflict detection and resolution

### User Feedback (10%)
- Community validation scores
- Expert review ratings
- Usage patterns and adoption
- Reported accuracy feedback

## Technical Architecture

- **Scoring Engine**: ML-based trust calculation system
- **Validation Pipeline**: Automated fact-checking and verification
- **Feedback System**: User and expert input collection
- **Visualization Layer**: Trust indicator display components
- **Analytics Platform**: Trust trend analysis and reporting

## Trust Score Ranges

- **90-100**: Highly Trusted (Green) - Verified, reliable sources
- **70-89**: Trusted (Blue) - Generally reliable with minor uncertainties
- **50-69**: Moderate (Yellow) - Mixed reliability, use with caution
- **30-49**: Low Trust (Orange) - Questionable reliability, verify independently
- **0-29**: Untrusted (Red) - High risk, likely unreliable or false

## Dependencies

- **SPEC-001**: Core Memory System (memory data foundation)
- **SPEC-060**: Property Graph Memory Model (relationship analysis)
- **SPEC-040**: Feedback Loop AI Context (user feedback integration)
- **SPEC-075**: Unified Frontend Architecture (trust visualization)

## Privacy & Security

- **Transparent Scoring**: Clear explanation of trust calculation methods
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of trust score changes
- **Bias Prevention**: Regular algorithm auditing for fairness
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of trust-related metadata
- **User Control**: Ability to adjust trust sensitivity settings

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 95% accuracy in identifying unreliable memories
- [ ] <200ms trust score calculation time
- [ ] 90% user satisfaction with trust indicators
- [ ] Integration with 5+ external fact-checking services
- [ ] Measurable reduction in decision errors based on memory trust
