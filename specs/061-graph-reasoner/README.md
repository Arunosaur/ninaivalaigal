# SPEC-061: Property Graph Intelligence Framework

## Overview

SPEC-061 implements an intelligent reasoning layer over the Apache AGE property graph (SPEC-060) with Redis-backed performance optimization. This specification enables AI-aligned memory graph reasoning, dynamic context injection, and advanced graph intelligence capabilities.

## Strategic Value

Building on the Redis performance foundation (SPEC-033) and Apache AGE graph model (SPEC-060), SPEC-061 provides:

- **Graph Intelligence Layer**: Multi-hop, weighted traversal with intelligent reasoning
- **Context Explanation**: Shows "why" a memory was retrieved with traceable paths
- **Relevance Inference**: Suggests next-best memories or agents based on proximity
- **Feedback Loop**: Refines graph traversal using ranking signals and user feedback
- **Network Analysis**: Comprehensive memory network insights and pattern detection

## Core Components

### 1. GraphReasoner Class

**File**: `server/graph/graph_reasoner.py`

The main intelligence engine that provides:

- **explain_context()**: Traceable memory retrieval explanations
- **infer_relevance()**: Proximity-based memory and agent suggestions
- **feedback_loop()**: Graph weight updates based on user feedback
- **analyze_memory_network()**: Network structure analysis and insights

### 2. Data Models

**ReasoningPath**: Represents a path through the graph with weights and confidence
**ContextExplanation**: Explanation for why a memory was retrieved
**RelevanceInference**: Suggestions based on graph proximity analysis

### 3. Redis-Backed Caching

All reasoning operations are cached in Redis with appropriate TTLs:

- Context explanations: 5-minute TTL
- Relevance inferences: 5-minute TTL
- Network analysis: 10-minute TTL
- User traversal preferences: 24-hour TTL

## API Integration

### explain_context(memory_id, user_id, context_type, max_depth)

Shows why a memory was retrieved with traceable reasoning paths.

**Parameters**:
- `memory_id`: Target memory to explain
- `user_id`: User requesting explanation
- `context_type`: Type of context (retrieval, suggestion, inference)
- `max_depth`: Maximum graph traversal depth

**Returns**: `ContextExplanation` with reasoning paths and evidence

### infer_relevance(current_memory_id, user_id, suggestion_count)

Suggests relevant memories and agents based on graph proximity.

**Parameters**:
- `current_memory_id`: Current memory context
- `user_id`: User requesting suggestions
- `suggestion_count`: Number of suggestions to return

**Returns**: `RelevanceInference` with suggested memories and agents

### feedback_loop(user_id, memory_id, feedback_type, feedback_score, context_data)

Refines graph traversal using user feedback and ranking signals.

**Parameters**:
- `user_id`: User providing feedback
- `memory_id`: Memory being rated
- `feedback_type`: Type of feedback (relevance, accuracy, usefulness)
- `feedback_score`: Numerical score (0.0 to 1.0)
- `context_data`: Additional context information

**Returns**: Updated graph weights and traversal parameters

### analyze_memory_network(user_id, analysis_type, time_window)

Analyzes user's memory network for insights and patterns.

**Parameters**:
- `user_id`: User whose network to analyze
- `analysis_type`: Type of analysis (comprehensive, recent, patterns)
- `time_window`: Optional time window for analysis

**Returns**: Network analysis with structure, patterns, and insights

## Performance Requirements

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

- **explain_context**: < 100ms (cold cache), < 10ms (warm cache)
- **infer_relevance**: < 150ms (cold cache), < 15ms (warm cache)
- **feedback_loop**: < 50ms for feedback storage and weight updates
- **analyze_memory_network**: < 200ms (cold cache), < 20ms (warm cache)

### Caching Strategy

- **Cache-first approach**: Check Redis before computing results
- **Intelligent TTLs**: Balance freshness with performance
- **Cache invalidation**: Feedback operations invalidate related caches
- **User-scoped keys**: Ensure security and performance isolation

## Graph Intelligence Features

### Multi-Hop Reasoning

- Traverses graph relationships up to configurable depth
- Weights paths by relationship strength and confidence
- Considers multiple reasoning paths for robust explanations

### Proximity-Based Suggestions

- Calculates graph distance between memories and agents
- Combines proximity with relevance scores and activity metrics
- Provides confidence scores for suggestion quality

### Adaptive Learning

- Stores user feedback as weighted edges in the graph
- Updates traversal parameters based on feedback patterns
- Maintains user-specific preferences in Redis

### Network Pattern Detection

- Identifies hub nodes with high connectivity
- Detects isolated memories and connection opportunities
- Analyzes network density and structural metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**File**: `tests/unit/test_graph_reasoner_unit.py`

- Comprehensive mocking of Apache AGE and Redis dependencies
- Data model validation and edge case handling

### Performance Benchmarks

**File**: `tests/performance/benchmark_reasoner.py`
