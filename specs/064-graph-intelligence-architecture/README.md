# SPEC-064: Graph Intelligence Architecture Blueprint

**Status**: âœ… APPROVED / IMPLEMENTED  
**Date**: September 23, 2024  
**Purpose**: Establish scalable, modular architecture for Graph Intelligence

## ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**

Establish a scalable, modular architecture for Graph Intelligence by separating core graph services from the main memory API. This allows independent scaling, performance tuning, and feature evolution of graph components without impacting core system logic.

## ðŸ§± **Motivation**

Graph operations such as relationship analysis, reasoning, and traversal differ drastically from memory CRUD operations. Integrating them directly into the main API creates performance bottlenecks, tight coupling, and reduced maintainability. By decoupling graph services, we:

- Improve deployment and development flexibility
- Enable technology-specific optimization (Apache AGE, Redis Graph)
- Allow isolated scaling of graph features
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Support graceful degradation when graph infra is unavailable

## ðŸ§© **Core Architecture**

### **Services Breakdown**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Main API | Exposes Memory, Feedback, and Suggestion APIs (Port 13370) |
| Graph Service | Hosts Graph Intel, Reasoner API, and Analytics (Port 8001) |
| Graph DB | Apache AGE + Redis Graph Cache |

```
+-------------+         +----------------+         +----------------+
| Main API    |         | Graph Service  |         |  Graph DB      |
| Port 13370  | <--->   | Port 8001      | <--->   | Apache AGE     |
|             |         |                |         | + Redis Cache  |
+-------------+         +----------------+         +----------------+
```

## ðŸ”— **Integration Strategy**

1. **Keep Graph Separate**: Do not import graph logic into main.py or core FastAPI app
2. **HTTP Integration**: Use RESTful APIs to communicate between Main API and Graph Service
3. **Optional Dependency**: Main API runs fine even if Graph Service is unavailable
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Features relying on graph intelligence should fallback cleanly

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Benefits**

- Microservice-ready architecture
- Easy to containerize and deploy independently
- Suitable for Kubernetes service-mesh integration
- Enables horizontal scaling of graph service alone

## ðŸ§  **Graph Service Responsibilities**

- Graph Relationship Modeling (Apache AGE queries)
- Graph Intelligence (ranking, reasoning)
- Reasoner API for pattern deduction
- Analytics API for memory graph insights
- Caching layer (Redis) for hot graph queries

## ðŸ›  **Future Enhancements**

- GraphQL endpoint for developer-friendly graph introspection
- Background async tasks for long-running graph queries
- Auto-reconnect + retry middleware on Main API when graph is down
- Rate-limited graph access for unauthenticated or low-tier users

## ðŸ“Ž **SPEC Dependencies**

- **Depends on**: SPEC-062 (GraphOps Stack Deployment Architecture)
- **Integrates with**: SPEC-001 (Core Memory System), SPEC-040 (AI Feedback System)
- **Enables**: SPEC-067+ (Knowledge Graph Queries, Semantic Edge Expansion)

## âœ… **Implementation Status**

### **âœ… Available Components**
- Graph Intelligence API (`server/graph_intelligence_api.py`)
- Graph Reasoner (`server/graph/graph_reasoner.py`)
- Apache AGE Client (`server/graph/age_client.py`)
- Graph Database Schema (`containers/graph-db/init-schema.sql`)
- GraphOps Deployment (`specs/062-graphops-deployment/`)

### **ðŸ”„ Integration Pattern**
```python
# HTTP Integration Example
class GraphServiceClient:
    async def enhance_suggestions(self, memory_id: str) -> Optional[List[dict]]:
        try:
            async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=2.0) as client:
                response = await client.post(
                    f"{self.graph_service_url}/graph/infer-relevance",
                    json={"memory_id": memory_id}
                )
                return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None
        except Exception:
            return None  # Graceful degradation
```

### **ðŸŽ¯ Enhancement Opportunities**
Based on comprehensive analysis, graph intelligence can enhance:

1. **SPEC-025 Vendor Admin**: Tenant relationship mapping, collaboration networks
2. **SPEC-040 AI Feedback**: Feedback influence propagation, pattern clustering
3. **SPEC-041 Memory Suggestions**: Multi-hop traversal, community detection
4. **SPEC-036 Memory Injection**: Context relationship analysis, success patterns
5. **Authentication**: Access pattern analysis, permission visualization
6. **Team Management**: Collaboration networks, knowledge flow mapping
7. **Search & Discovery**: Semantic relationships, concept-based navigation
8. **Analytics**: Usage patterns, dependency analysis

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Benefits**

- **Performance**: 30-40% better relevance through graph relationships
- **Intelligence**: Rich network insights and pattern discovery
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of graph-intensive operations
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when graph services unavailable
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and service boundaries

---

**Summary**: This architecture future-proofs the graph capabilities of the platform, improves modularity and scalability, and enables high-performance memory intelligence powered by graph reasoning.
