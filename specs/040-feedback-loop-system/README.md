# SPEC-040: Feedback Loop System (Memory Accuracy + Relevance Signals)

## Status
📋 PLANNED

## Objective
Implement a feedback loop mechanism to continuously improve memory relevance and accuracy using implicit and explicit user feedback.

## Features
- 🔁 Implicit Feedback:
  - Query dwell time tracking
  - Memory token click-through analysis
  - Navigation patterns and memory re-visitation
- 🗣️ Explicit Feedback:
  - Thumbs-up/thumbs-down scoring on memory recalls
  - Inline feedback form for memory quality notes
- 🧠 Memory Token Score Adjustment:
  - Apply relevance boosting/demotion based on usage signals
  - Decay model for stale feedback influence
- 📊 Metrics & Observability:
  - Feedback event logging via Redis Queue
  - Dashboards for feedback trends, token accuracy rates, false recall rate

## Dependencies
- ✅ SPEC-033: Redis Queue (for feedback tasks)
- ✅ SPEC-031: Relevance Scoring Model (to apply feedback weights)
- 🔄 SPEC-039: Memory Tags (optional for feedback tag correlation)

## Technical Notes
- Feedback data stored in Redis for real-time ingestion
- Background worker adjusts token weights asynchronously
- Admin panel to review memory feedback and manually intervene if needed

## Benefits
- Continuous improvement loop for memory accuracy
- Allows platform to learn from usage patterns
- Differentiates from static memory systems with AI-assisted dynamic refinement
