# Feature Specification: PostgreSQL Migration for Production

**Feature Branch**: `003-postgresql-migration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Planned  
**Input**: Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production multi-user deployment with zero downtime

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need to migrate the memory system from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production deployment, so that the system can handle multiple concurrent users with proper performance and reliability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** system is running on SQLite, **When** migration is executed, **Then** all existing data is preserved in PostgreSQL
2. **Given** PostgreSQL is active, **When** multiple users access simultaneously, **Then** system maintains performance and data integrity
3. **Given** migration fails, **When** rollback is triggered, **Then** system returns to SQLite without data loss
4. **Given** PostgreSQL is configured, **When** system restarts, **Then** it automatically connects to PostgreSQL

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PostgreSQL connection fails during active sessions?
- How does system handle schema version mismatches between SQLite and PostgreSQL?
- What occurs during migration if disk space is insufficient?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate all existing SQLite data to PostgreSQL without loss
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both SQLite and PostgreSQL configurations
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide automated migration scripts with validation
- **FR-004**: System MUST include rollback capability to SQLite if PostgreSQL fails
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain schema compatibility between database types
- **FR-006**: System MUST support Docker-based PostgreSQL deployment
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide environment-based database switching
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate data integrity after migration
- **FR-009**: System MUST support connection pooling for PostgreSQL
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide backup and restore capabilities

### Key Entities
- **Migration Script**: Automated process to transfer data between database systems
- **Database Configuration**: Environment-specific settings for database connections
- **Schema Version**: Versioned database structure for compatibility tracking
- **Connection Pool**: Managed database connections for performance optimization
