# SPEC-052: Comprehensive Test Coverage & Edge Case Validation

**Title:** Complete Test Coverage & Edge Case Validation for Enterprise Quality
**Status:** DRAFT
**Created On:** 2025-09-21
**Category:** Quality Assurance & Platform Reliability
**Author:** ninaivalaigal/core
**Related SPECs:** All SPECs (000-051)

---

## 🎯 Goal

Ensure the ninaivalaigal platform has complete unit, integration, and edge case test coverage across all core, intelligence, and infrastructure SPECs.

**Why This Is Critical Now:**
- You have **48 SPECs**, with only ~8-10 fully tested and validated
- Many features are **documented but not tested**, including key AI components and ACL logic
- Previous formatting and OpenAPI issues underscore the importance of **robust pre-commit and CI validations**
- Redis integration claims, ACL role permissions, and memory drift systems all need **assertive edge validation** to meet enterprise-grade quality

---

## 🔹 Core Features

### ✅ Test Harness Expansion
Add test harness coverage for:
- All 48 SPECs (split by functional category)
- All implemented API endpoints (currently ~80%)

### 🔧 Edge Case Coverage

#### **ACL System**
- Conflicting permissions, rapid access changes, unauthorized access attempts

#### **Memory Sharing**
- Cross-org ACL leakage, double-delegation, loop references

#### **Drift Detection**
- Identical content with formatting changes, deleted tokens

#### **Feedback Loop**
- Malicious feedback or spam scoring

#### **Redis Fallback**
- Redis offline scenario handling

#### **🧠 AI Behavior Under Load**
- Simulate concurrent memory drift, ranking, feedback ingestion
- Test multi-user sessions with stale/expired tokens

#### **📱 Session Management**
- Validate start/end conditions
- Memory carry-over across sessions

### 🔥 Infrastructure Edge
- Container restarts
- Redis dropped connections
- DB failovers or API cold starts

## 📈 Metrics To Track

- **Code Coverage %** (Target: >90%)
- **SPEC-wise Test Matrix** (Implemented vs Validated)
- **Regression Test Suite Duration**
- **Test Failures by Category**

---

## 🧰 Tooling

- **pytest** (unit + integration tests)
- **coverage.py** or **pytest-cov** for per-SPEC coverage report
- **Edge case test scripts** in `/tests/edge/`
- **Optional**: Fuzzing using **hypothesis** (for memory tokens, session replay, etc.)

## 📁 Directory Structure Suggestion

```bash
/tests
  /core
    test_spec_001_memory.py
    test_spec_002_auth.py
  /intelligence
    test_spec_040_feedback.py
    test_spec_042_health.py
    test_spec_044_drift.py
  /infra
    test_spec_013_multiarch.py
  /edge
    test_acl_edge.py
    test_redis_fallback.py
    test_token_expiry.py
```

---

## 🔁 Integration with GitHub Actions (CI)

- Add `make test-all-edge-cases`
- Validate:
  - Edge case success
  - No regressions from previously passing SPECs
- Slack/Email notification on test failure

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Next Immediate Actions**
1. **Start Infrastructure**: `make stack-up`
2. **Run Validation Tests**: `make validate-top-5-specs`
3. **Fix Critical Issues**: Address any failing tests
4. **Expand Test Coverage**: Implement remaining SPEC-052 test cases
5. **Performance Validation**: Confirm Redis performance claims

## 📋 **SPEC-052 VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

### ✅ **Infrastructure**
- [x] Redis running
- [x] PgBouncer connected
- [x] API reachable

### ❌ **Authentication**
- [ ] Token generation and parsing
- [ ] RBAC role enforcement
- [ ] Signup/Login routes working

### ⚠️ **Intelligence**
- [ ] SPEC-031 endpoints return data
- [ ] SPEC-040 health check passes

### ❌ **Core Memory**
- [ ] /memory/create returns 200
- [ ] /memory/search returns results

*This lets us track daily what lights up.*

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Test structure created (`/tests/core`, `/intelligence`, `/edge`)
- Top 5 critical SPECs have comprehensive test coverage
- Edge cases identified and documented

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Coverage
- All implemented SPECs have >90% test coverage
- Edge case scenarios pass consistently
- CI integration prevents regressions

### Phase 3: Enterprise Quality
- Automated edge case detection
- Performance regression testing
- Complete SPEC validation matrix

---

## 🎯 Strategic Value

**Quality Assurance**: Transforms platform from "implemented" to "enterprise-tested"
**Risk Mitigation**: Prevents production failures through comprehensive edge case coverage
**Developer Confidence**: Clear validation status for all 48 SPECs
**Enterprise Readiness**: Meets enterprise-grade testing standards
