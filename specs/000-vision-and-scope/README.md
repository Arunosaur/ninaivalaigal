# SPEC-000: Vision & Scope

## Title
Vision & Scope of the Ninaivalaigal System

## Objective
Define the high-level architecture, purpose, and guiding principles of the platform.

## Vision
"To create a persistent, shareable, and context-aware memory system for individuals, teams, and organizations — tightly integrated with AI workflows to preserve scope, enable collaboration, and empower continuous learning."

## Pillars

| Pillar             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Memory             | Long-term, structured information storage accessible across scopes |
| Scope              | Contextual isolation between personal, team, and org memories |
| Transferability    | Memory can move up/down scopes based on permissions |
| AI Context         | AI receives scoped memory tokens, ensuring it stays on track |
| Security           | All access is RBAC-controlled with audit and redaction support |
| Infrastructure     | Portable, observable, multi-cloud container stack |

## Architectural Elements

- Memory API: Universal memory operations (store, update, delete, recall)
- Context Engine: Injects memory into AI prompts based on role/scope
- Memory Providers: Native, HTTP, or plugin-based backends
- RBAC: Fine-grained controls for who can see/use memory
- Telemetry: Metrics and logs for memory usage and system health

## Status
✅ Drafted — will be saved as `specs/000-vision-and-scope.md`
