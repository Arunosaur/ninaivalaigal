# mem0 Project Vision

This document outlines the core vision and architectural principles for the `mem0` project. It serves as a permanent record of our goals to prevent agentic drift and ensure all development work remains aligned with the high-level objectives.

## Core Problem

AI development agents, including this one, lack long-term memory. They get lost in long conversations, forget key decisions, and lose track of the original requirements. This forces the user to constantly repeat themselves and correct the agent's course.

**Modern software development also suffers from knowledge fragmentation**: Individual knowledge trapped in personal notes, team knowledge lost in incomplete documentation, organizational knowledge scattered across wikis and tribal knowledge.

## The Vision

`mem0` is a **universal memory layer** that transforms how humans and AI agents collaborate across the entire software development lifecycle. From a simple CCTV-like observer, mem0 evolves into a comprehensive knowledge management platform that enables seamless collaboration from individual developers to enterprise teams.

### Core Philosophy: Simple Like CCTV

- **Just an Observer**: Silently watches and records when turned on
- **On/Off Switch**: Easy to start/stop - complexities hidden behind the scenes
- **Multi-Context Support**: Handle multiple projects, but keep user experience minimal
- **AI Agent Helper**: Primary purpose is helping other AI agents maintain context
- **Universal Sharing**: From personal to enterprise without complexity

### Key Pillars

1.  **From Developer to Automation:** The system must capture the iterative, often messy, process of interactive development and transform it into structured, machine-readable data. This data will then be used to automatically generate documentation, reports, andâ€”most importantlyâ€”automation scripts (e.g., Ansible playbooks).

2.  **From Individual to Team:** The system must be usable by a single developer on their local machine, but also be deployable as a shared, central service for an entire team. It must support multiple, distinct contexts for different projects and tasks.

3.  **From UI to CLI:** The core of the system will be a headless, API-driven server. All user interfaces (VS Code extensions, JetBrains plugins, terminal clients) will be thin clients that talk to this server. This ensures portability and consistency.

4.  **From Personal to Enterprise:** The system must scale from individual productivity to enterprise knowledge management, supporting organizations, teams, and cross-functional collaboration without sacrificing simplicity.

5.  **From Human to Human-AI Collaboration:** Enable seamless collaboration between humans and AI agents, with persistent memory that bridges conversation context windows and maintains long-term project awareness.

## Evolution Roadmap

## Architectural Principles

### Simplicity First
- **Zero-configuration**: Works out of the box
- **Simple mental model**: Contexts, memories, sharing
- **Progressive complexity**: Advanced features don't complicate basic usage
- **Consistent UX**: Same patterns across all interfaces

### Security by Design
- **User isolation**: Cryptographic separation of user data
- **Permission inheritance**: Hierarchical access control
- **Audit trails**: Complete tracking of sharing activities
- **Privacy protection**: Users control their data sharing

### AI-Centric Design
- **Memory persistence**: Bridge AI conversation context windows
- **Structured data**: Machine-readable development activities
- **Multi-agent support**: Enable AI agent collaboration
- **Future-proof**: Designed for AI tool ecosystem integration

### Scalability Architecture
- **Horizontal scaling**: Microservices-ready design
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple organizations
- **Performance optimization**: Caching and background processing
- **Cloud-native**: Deployment flexibility across platforms

## The Agent's Commitment

I, the AI agent, will read this document before making any significant architectural decisions or starting any major new development task. It will serve as my anchor to ensure I do not deviate from our shared goals and maintain alignment with the evolution from individual tool to enterprise platform to AI-native ecosystem.

**Key Reminders:**
- Keep the user experience simple, even as features grow
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations
- Ensure all features support the multi-level sharing architecture
- Prioritize AI agent integration and memory persistence
- Scale from individual to enterprise without complexity creep
