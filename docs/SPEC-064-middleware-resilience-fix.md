# SPEC-064: Middleware Resilience Fix

---

## 🎯 Objective

To fix a blocking issue in the `/auth/*` request path caused by broken Redis-dependent middleware and restore normal authentication functionality.

---

## 🧩 Problem Summary

- Middleware in `security_integration.py` was intercepting `/auth/*` requests
- It attempted to log to Redis via `log_security_event(...)`
- Redis client was broken (`set` method missing), causing request hang
- FastAPI never processed the handler — request timed out at middleware layer

---

## 🔍 Diagnosis & Evidence

- All `/auth/*` endpoints hung indefinitely
- Other routes worked instantly
- Adding `/user-login` without `/auth` prefix worked perfectly
- Commenting Redis logging restored functionality

---

## ✅ Fix Implementation

- Disabled `configure_security(app)` in `main.py`
- Commented middleware intercepting `/auth/*` in `security_integration.py`
- Disabled MetricsMiddleware (precautionary)
- Preserved backup `/user-login` endpoint
- Updated dev instructions for local testing

---

## 🧪 Tests

- ✅ `/auth/login` responds successfully
- ✅ `/user-login` fallback operational  
- ✅ All services and imports stable
- ✅ JWT token generation working
- ✅ No regression in other endpoints

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Security event logging is disabled temporarily
- Core authentication logic unchanged
- Password hashing and JWT signing still active
- Redis client requires patching or timeout handling

---

## 📅 Next Cycle Goals

- Replace or patch Redis client with proper `.set()` method
- Add timeout handling to all async middleware calls
- Implement graceful fallback for Redis failures
- Re-enable security pipeline with resilience patterns

---

**Status**: ✅ Approved — merged for stability
