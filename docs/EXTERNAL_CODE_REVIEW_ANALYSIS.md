## 🔍 EXPERT INSIGHTS WE AGREE WITH

### 1. Memory Model Security
**Expert Observation**: "Schema clarity, transaction-level access tokens, memory entries, subsets/tags, ACLs, org/team membership, sharing grants, audit events"
**Our Agreement**: This validates our context scope system and highlights need for enhanced audit trails

### 2. Observability Gap
**Expert Observation**: "OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs" with "RED metrics per endpoint"
**Our Agreement**: Critical missing piece for production deployment

### 3. Data Governance
**Expert Observation**: "Retention settings per org; export & delete endpoints with approvals"
**Our Agreement**: Essential for GDPR compliance and enterprise adoption

### 4. Shell Security
**Expert Observation**: "Command capture bursts" vulnerability
**Our Agreement**: Critical oversight in our CCTV recording system

## 🚫 AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT

### 1. CodeRabbit Integration
**Expert Recommendation**: CodeRabbit for PR reviews
**Our Position**: **Partially Disagree** - While CodeRabbit is good, we prefer DeepSource for static analysis due to:
- Better Python security rule coverage
- More comprehensive autofix capabilities
- Superior integration with our tech stack

**Compromise**: Use CodeRabbit for PR summaries, DeepSource for security analysis

### 2. Repository Restructuring Priority
**Expert Recommendation**: Immediate repository reorganization
**Our Position**: **Timing Disagreement** - While we agree with the structure, we recommend:
- **Phase 1**: Security fixes first (P0 issues)
- **Phase 2**: Repository restructuring (P2 priority)
- **Reason**: Security vulnerabilities pose immediate risk, restructuring can wait
