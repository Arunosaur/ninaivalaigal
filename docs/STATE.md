### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T16:35:02Z
*   **Action:** Aligned on the correct next step for the "CCTV Camera" vision.
*   **Details:** The agent (me) correctly identified that building a "smarter remember" command violates the passive listening principle. The new plan is to build a shell wrapper for automatic command capture.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Design and implement the "Passive Listener" shell wrapper.
*   **Purpose:** To create a mechanism that automatically captures terminal commands and their output during a recording session, fulfilling the core of our CCTV vision.
