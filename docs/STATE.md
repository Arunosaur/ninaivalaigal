### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T14:45:22-05:00
*   **Action:** MAJOR MILESTONE - Complete IDE Integration and Testing Infrastructure
*   **Details:** 
    - **IDE Integration**: Created comprehensive guide for VS Code, JetBrains, Zed, and Warp terminal
    - **Testing Infrastructure**: Added environment testing script with full validation
    - **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide and troubleshooting documentation
    - **Version Control**: All changes committed to git (commit 642d903)
    - **Multi-Environment Support**: Verified compatibility across different development environments
    - **Ready for Authentication**: Foundation prepared for user authentication implementation

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Implement user authentication and context isolation
*   **Purpose:** Enable true multi-user support with secure context isolation
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1. Add JWT-based authentication endpoints
    2. Update all API endpoints to require user context
    3. Add user registration/login CLI commands
    4. Test user isolation with authentication
*   **Testing Available:**
    1. Run: `./tests/test_environments.sh` for comprehensive validation
    2. Review: `docs/IDE_INTEGRATION.md` for setup instructions
    3. Deploy: Use `deploy/` directory for production VM deployment

### Blockers / Open Questions:

*   Need to implement user authentication before true multi-user deployment
*   Current context isolation is by name only (no user security)

### Current System Architecture:

*   **Server:** FastAPI-based memory storage API (port 13370) with SQLAlchemy ORM
*   **Client:** Python CLI tool with shell integration
*   **VS Code Extension:** TypeScript-based IDE integration
*   **Data Storage:** Database-backed (SQLite default, PostgreSQL ready)
*   **Multi-user:** User isolation implemented with user_id associations

### Process Notes:

*   At the end of every session, or if no response is received for ~10 minutes, the agent will update this `STATE.md` file to ensure no work is lost.
*   All file changes are being tracked and version controlled as requested.
