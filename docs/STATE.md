### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T13:43:54Z
*   **Action:** Conducted a full end-to-end test from the VS Code UI.
*   **Details:** The test failed, revealing two critical bugs: 1) The CLI fails to detect the `git` context due to an incorrect working directory. 2) The `recall` command incorrectly passes extra arguments, causing a parser error.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Fix the `cwd` and argument parsing bugs in the `vscode-client`.
*   **Purpose:** To resolve the final blockers and produce a truly working end-to-end system.
