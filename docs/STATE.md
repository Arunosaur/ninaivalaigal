# mem0 Project State

This document tracks the current state of our development work. It serves as a short-term memory to ensure continuity across sessions and conversation contexts.

---

### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T12:32:37-05:00
*   **Action:** Fixed shell wrapper command capture issue and added diagnostic logging
*   **Details:** 
    - Added missing `context active` command to CLI tool (`/client/mem0`)
    - Enhanced `mem0.zsh` with diagnostic logging (enable with `MEM0_DEBUG=1`)
    - Fixed JSON parsing logic to handle null values properly
    - Shell wrapper should now correctly capture commands when recording context is active

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Test the complete system end-to-end
*   **Purpose:** Verify that the shell wrapper now correctly captures commands and the server stores them properly
*   **Steps:** 
    1. Start server with `./manage.sh start`
    2. Start recording context with `./client/mem0 context start test-session`
    3. Source the shell wrapper with `source client/mem0.zsh`
    4. Run test commands and verify capture
    5. Check stored memories with `./client/mem0 recall --context test-session`

### Blockers / Open Questions:

*   Need to test if the client dependencies are properly installed (requests library)
*   May need to set up Python virtual environment for client

### Current System Architecture:

*   **Server:** FastAPI-based memory storage API (port 13370)
*   **Client:** Python CLI tool with shell integration
*   **VS Code Extension:** TypeScript-based IDE integration
*   **Data Storage:** JSON file-based persistence (`mem0_data.json`)

### Process Notes:

*   At the end of every session, or if no response is received for ~10 minutes, the agent will update this `STATE.md` file to ensure no work is lost.
*   All file changes are being tracked and version controlled as requested.
