### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T10:52:18Z
*   **Action:** Attempted the first end-to-end test.
*   **Details:** The test failed. The client received a `404 Not Found` error, indicating the server was started incorrectly. An attempt to `kill` the rogue server process was unsuccessful.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Find and stop the rogue server process.
*   **Purpose:** To clear the port and allow the server to be started correctly, unblocking our end-to-end test.

### Blockers / Open Questions:

*   A `uvicorn` or `python3` process is currently holding port 13370 open, preventing the server from starting correctly. This process must be terminated.

### Blockers / Open Questions:

*   None at this time.
