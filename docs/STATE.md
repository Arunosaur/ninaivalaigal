### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T17:12:46Z
*   **Action:** Ran the second test of the "Passive Listener" shell wrapper.
*   **Details:** The test failed again. The simplified `mem0.zsh` script is still not correctly capturing commands.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Add diagnostic logging to the `mem0.zsh` script.
*   **Purpose:** To get visibility into the script's execution and finally identify the root cause of the bug in our command capture logic.
