### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T11:30:35Z
*   **Action:** Successfully tested the `export` command.
*   **Details:** Using a new, encapsulated test script (`run_test.sh`), we verified that the system can correctly store structured data and export it to a Markdown file.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Enhance the CLI to support automatic context detection.
*   **Purpose:** To make the tool more user-friendly by automatically detecting the current project/context from the environment (e.g., from the current `git` branch or directory), removing the need for the user to specify `--context` for every command.
