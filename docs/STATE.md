### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T10:34:44Z
*   **Action:** Implemented the `mem0` CLI tool.
*   **Details:** The CLI tool can now `remember`, `recall`, and `context switch` by making API calls to the `mem0-server`.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Conduct an end-to-end test of our system.
*   **Purpose:** To verify that the CLI tool and the server are working together correctly. This will involve starting the server and then using the CLI to perform a series of memory operations.
