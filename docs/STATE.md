# mem0 Project State

## Current Status (2025-09-10)
- âœ… FastAPI server running on port 13370 with PostgreSQL
- âœ… PostgreSQL database active and tested (Docker container)
- âœ… CLI tool for memory management with context isolation
- âœ… Shell integration (zsh) with automatic command/result capture
- âœ… VS Code extension with chat participant and context persistence
- âœ… MCP server implementation complete and tested
- âœ… Cross-platform testing suite passing all tests
- âœ… Ansible deployment scripts for PostgreSQL setup

## Key Components
1. **FastAPI Server** (`server/main.py`) - REST API backend with context-filtered endpoints
2. **MCP Server** (`server/mcp_server.py`) - Model Context Protocol server for AI tool integration
3. **Database** (`server/database.py`) - PostgreSQL with context-based memory isolation
4. **CLI** (`client/mem0`) - Command-line interface with context management
5. **Shell Integration** (`client/mem0.zsh`) - Automatic capture via preexec/precmd hooks
6. **VS Code Extension** (`vscode-client/`) - Chat participant with persistent context state

## Configuration
- Server: `mem0.config.json` (port 13370, PostgreSQL settings)
- Shell: Environment variables (`MEM0_CONTEXT`, `MEM0_DEBUG`)
- VS Code: Extension settings for project root and context persistence

## Working Features
- Context isolation: memories properly filtered by context name
- Automatic command capture: shell integration records commands/results
- VS Code integration: @mem0 chat participant with debug output
- Context persistence: VS Code extension maintains context across commands
- CLI context management: start/stop/switch contexts

## Recent Major Fixes (2025-09-10)
- Fixed VS Code extension activation (onStartupFinished + popup notifications)
- Implemented context persistence in VS Code extension (global currentContext)
- Enhanced shell integration with command result capture (precmd hooks)
- Added automatic CLI context start when using VS Code context start
- Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

## MCP Server Integration
- âœ… MCP server implemented with Tools, Resources, and Prompts
- âœ… All core functionality available via MCP protocol
- âœ… Tested and verified working with existing database
- ðŸ”„ Ready for Claude Desktop and other MCP client integration

### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-10T15:57:00-05:00
*   **Action:** PostgreSQL Activation & Cross-Platform Testing Complete
*   **Details:** 
    - **PostgreSQL**: Activated PostgreSQL database with Docker, all systems now using PostgreSQL
    - **FastAPI Testing**: Verified FastAPI server working with PostgreSQL backend
    - **MCP Testing**: Fixed MCP server issues, all tools working with PostgreSQL
    - **Cross-Platform Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite, all tests passing
    - **Deployment Ready**: Created Ansible playbooks, Docker setup for production deployment
    - **Documentation**: Updated STATE.md with current PostgreSQL status and testing results

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Future Enhancement Evaluation
*   **Purpose:** Assess potential improvements aligned with project vision
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1. Evaluate automation generation capabilities (Vision Pillar 1: Developer to Automation)
    2. Consider authentication/security for team deployment (Vision Pillar 2: Individual to Team)
    3. Explore additional shell support beyond Zsh
    4. Assess integration opportunities with other development tools

### Blockers / Open Questions:

*   None - core system is complete and production-ready
*   All major multi-context functionality implemented and tested
*   Documentation comprehensive and up-to-date

### Current System Architecture:

*   **Server:** FastAPI-based memory storage API (port 13370) with SQLAlchemy ORM
*   **Client:** Python CLI tool with enhanced multi-context support
*   **Shell Integration:** Zsh wrapper with MEM0_CONTEXT environment variable support
*   **VS Code Extension:** TypeScript-based IDE integration
*   **Data Storage:** Database-backed (SQLite default, PostgreSQL ready)
*   **Multi-Context:** Multiple active contexts per user with per-terminal selection
*   **Context Management:** Start, stop, delete, list operations with user isolation

### Process Notes:

*   At the end of every session, or if no response is received for ~10 minutes, the agent will update this `STATE.md` file to ensure no work is lost.
*   All file changes are being tracked and version controlled as requested.
