### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T12:50:43Z
*   **Action:** Ran a test of the bundled extension.
*   **Details:** The test failed. While the pathing issue is resolved, the extension is not correctly capturing and displaying the output from the CLI tool.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Refactor the extension to use `spawn` instead of `execFile`.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a more robust and direct method of inter-process communication that will correctly capture and stream the CLI's output.
