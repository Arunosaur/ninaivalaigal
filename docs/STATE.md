*   **Details:** All test scripts have been moved, and a `.gitignore` file has been added to keep the repository clean.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Begin work on the UI clients, starting with the VS Code extension.
*   **Purpose:** To bring the power of our `mem0` system to the place where developers spend most of their time. This is the first step in fulfilling our "UI to CLI" vision.
