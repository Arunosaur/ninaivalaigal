### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T13:36:44-05:00
*   **Action:** MAJOR MILESTONE - Database Migration Completed
*   **Details:** 
    - **Database Backend**: Migrated from JSON files to SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL/SQLite support
    - **Multi-user Architecture**: Implemented user isolation with user_id associations
    - **Server Updates**: All endpoints now use database operations with proper error handling
    - **Migration**: Automatic migration from existing JSON data to database
    - **Testing**: All existing test suites pass with new database implementation
    - **Context Management**: Fixed /contexts endpoint, tested start/stop/list functionality

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Deploy with PostgreSQL for multi-user production environment
*   **Purpose:** Move from SQLite to PostgreSQL for team collaboration as per VISION.md
*   **Usage Instructions:**
    1. Start server: `cd server && uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 13370`
    2. Start recording: `./client/mem0 context start <session-name>`
    3. List contexts: `./client/mem0 contexts`
    4. Enable shell capture: `source client/mem0.zsh`
    5. View memories: `./client/mem0 recall --context <session-name>`

### Blockers / Open Questions:

*   None - PostgreSQL now running in Docker and fully functional

### Current System Architecture:

*   **Server:** FastAPI-based memory storage API (port 13370) with SQLAlchemy ORM
*   **Client:** Python CLI tool with shell integration
*   **VS Code Extension:** TypeScript-based IDE integration
*   **Data Storage:** Database-backed (SQLite default, PostgreSQL ready)
*   **Multi-user:** User isolation implemented with user_id associations

### Process Notes:

*   At the end of every session, or if no response is received for ~10 minutes, the agent will update this `STATE.md` file to ensure no work is lost.
*   All file changes are being tracked and version controlled as requested.
