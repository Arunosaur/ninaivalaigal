### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T12:41:23Z
*   **Action:** Fixed the extension pathing bug by bundling the `client`.
*   **Details:** The build script now copies the `client` directory into the extension's `dist` folder, and the extension now correctly calls the bundled executable. This makes the extension a self-contained package.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Re-run the final, full-system end-to-end test.
*   **Purpose:** To verify that the pathing bug is fixed and that the VS Code UI can successfully communicate with the CLI tool.
