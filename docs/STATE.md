    - **Database Backend**: Full PostgreSQL deployment with Docker container
    - **Multi-user Testing**: Verified context isolation between different users
    - **Production Ready**: Ansible deployment scripts and documentation complete
    - **Version Control**: All changes committed to git repository
    - **Documentation**: Created comprehensive deployment guide with troubleshooting
    - **Architecture**: System now supports team collaboration as per VISION.md goals

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** System ready for production deployment on VM
*   **Purpose:** Complete VISION.md goals - team collaboration with shared memory layer
*   **Deployment Instructions:**
    1. Configure `deploy/inventory.yml` with your VM details
    2. Run: `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ansible-playbook.yml`
    3. Access via: `http://your-server-ip/`
*   **Local Development:**
    1. Start PostgreSQL: `docker start mem0-postgres`
    2. Start server: `cd server && uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 13370`
    3. Use client: `./client/mem0 context start <session-name>`

### Blockers / Open Questions:

*   None - PostgreSQL now running in Docker and fully functional

### Current System Architecture:

*   **Server:** FastAPI-based memory storage API (port 13370) with SQLAlchemy ORM
*   **Client:** Python CLI tool with shell integration
*   **VS Code Extension:** TypeScript-based IDE integration
*   **Data Storage:** Database-backed (SQLite default, PostgreSQL ready)
*   **Multi-user:** User isolation implemented with user_id associations

### Process Notes:

*   At the end of every session, or if no response is received for ~10 minutes, the agent will update this `STATE.md` file to ensure no work is lost.
*   All file changes are being tracked and version controlled as requested.
