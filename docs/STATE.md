# mem0 Project State

This document tracks the current state of our development work. It serves as a short-term memory to ensure continuity across sessions and conversation contexts.

### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T16:52:38Z
*   **Action:** Ran the first test of the "Passive Listener" shell wrapper.
*   **Details:** The test failed. No memories were recorded, indicating a bug in the `mem0.zsh` script's output capture logic.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Simplify the `mem0.zsh` script to only capture the command string.
*   **Purpose:** To achieve a working "Passive Listener" for commands, which will serve as a solid foundation before we tackle the more complex challenge of output capture.
