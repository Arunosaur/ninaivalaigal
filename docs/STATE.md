### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T16:54:12Z
*   **Action:** Refactored the `mem0.zsh` script to be simpler and more robust.
*   **Details:** The script now only captures the command string, deferring the more complex output capture to a future iteration.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Re-run the test of the "Passive Listener" shell wrapper.
*   **Purpose:** To verify that our simplified Zsh integration can correctly capture and remember terminal commands.
