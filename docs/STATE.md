# mem0 Project State

This document tracks the current state of our development work. It serves as a short-term memory to ensure continuity across sessions and conversation contexts.

---

### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T12:36:55-05:00
*   **Action:** Successfully tested and validated the complete mem0 system
*   **Details:** 
    - Verified `context active` command works correctly
    - Tested memory storage and retrieval functionality
    - All existing test suites pass (run_test.sh, run_context_test.sh, run_session_test.sh)
    - System is fully operational and ready for use
    - Shell wrapper fix is confirmed working

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** System is ready for production use
*   **Purpose:** The shell wrapper command capture issue has been resolved
*   **Usage Instructions:**
    1. Start server: `./manage.sh start`
    2. Start recording: `./client/mem0 context start <session-name>`
    3. Enable shell capture: `source client/mem0.zsh`
    4. Enable debug logging: `export MEM0_DEBUG=1` (optional)
    5. View memories: `./client/mem0 recall --context <session-name>`

### Blockers / Open Questions:

*   None - system is fully functional

### Current System Architecture:

*   **Server:** FastAPI-based memory storage API (port 13370)
*   **Client:** Python CLI tool with shell integration
*   **VS Code Extension:** TypeScript-based IDE integration
*   **Data Storage:** JSON file-based persistence (`mem0_data.json`)

### Process Notes:

*   At the end of every session, or if no response is received for ~10 minutes, the agent will update this `STATE.md` file to ensure no work is lost.
*   All file changes are being tracked and version controlled as requested.
