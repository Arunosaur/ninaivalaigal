## Key Components

### Server Architecture
1. **FastAPI Server** (`server/main.py`) - REST API with JWT authentication and advanced sharing
2. **Database Layer** (`server/database.py`) - PostgreSQL with multi-user support and sharing models
3. **Authentication** (`server/auth.py`) - JWT middleware with user isolation
4. **MCP Server** (`server/mcp_server.py`) - Model Context Protocol for AI integration

### Client Architecture
1. **CLI Tool** (`client/mem0`) - Full-featured client with auth and sharing commands
2. **Shell Integration** (`client/mem0.zsh`) - Zsh hooks with context isolation
3. **VS Code Extension** (`vscode-client/`) - IDE integration with persistent state

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management
- **Organizations**: Top-level organizational units
- **Teams**: Groups within/across organizations with roles
- **TeamMembers**: User-team relationships with permissions
- **RecordingContexts**: Enhanced contexts with ownership and visibility
- **ContextPermissions**: Granular sharing permissions
- **Memories**: User-isolated memory storage

## Configuration

### Authentication
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration (30 minutes default)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token persistence in client (`~/.mem0/auth.json`)

### Sharing Hierarchy
1. **Personal**: Private contexts owned by individual users
2. **Team**: Shared within specific teams with role-based access
3. **Organization**: Shared across entire organizations
4. **Public**: Accessible to all authenticated users

### Permission Levels
- **Read**: View memories and context information
- **Write**: Create/modify memories in the context
- **Admin**: Manage sharing permissions and context settings
- **Owner**: Full control including deletion and ownership transfer

## Working Features

### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- User registration and login with password hashing
- Complete user isolation - no cross-user data access
- Environment variable spoofing prevention
- API key validation through JWT tokens

### Multi-Level Sharing
- Personal contexts (private to individual users)
- Team-shared contexts with role-based permissions
- Organization-wide contexts for company knowledge
- Cross-team project collaboration
- Flexible permission management

### Advanced Collaboration
- Organization and team management
- Multi-team participation for users
- Cross-organization team support
- Context ownership by users, teams, or organizations
- Permission inheritance and propagation
- Audit trail for sharing activities

### Performance & Reliability
- Context caching to minimize API calls
- Background command processing
- Connection pooling and session management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automatic health checks and monitoring

## Recent Major Fixes (2025-09-10)
- Fixed VS Code extension activation (onStartupFinished + popup notifications)
- Implemented context persistence in VS Code extension (global currentContext)
- Enhanced shell integration with command result capture (precmd hooks)
- Added automatic CLI context start when using VS Code context start
- Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

## MCP Server Integration
- âœ… MCP server implemented with Tools, Resources, and Prompts
- âœ… All core functionality available via MCP protocol
- âœ… Tested and verified working with existing database
- ðŸ”„ Ready for Claude Desktop and other MCP client integration

### Recent Major Enhancements (2025-09-10)
