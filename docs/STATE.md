# mem0 Project State

This document tracks the current state of our development work. It serves as a short-term memory to ensure continuity across sessions and conversation contexts.

### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T16:14:26Z
*   **Action:** Aligned on the "Controllable Recording Session" vision.
*   **Details:** The project will now follow a model where the user explicitly starts and stops recording sessions for different contexts. This provides greater user control and enables remote control of the memory.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Refactor the server and CLI to support the new session model.
*   **Purpose:** To implement the `context start` and `context stop` commands, which will be the core of the new user experience.
