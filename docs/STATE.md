### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T14:45:36Z
*   **Action:** Ran the final end-to-end test.
*   **Details:** The test failed. The extension correctly reported that it could not determine the workspace root, proving the `cwd` detection logic is flawed.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Refactor the extension to use a configurable setting for the project root.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a robust and explicit way for the extension to know where to run the CLI tool, resolving the final blocker.
