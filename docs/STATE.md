### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T12:50:43Z
*   **Action:** Refactored the `vscode-client` to use `spawn`.
*   **Details:** The extension now uses the more robust `spawn` method for inter-process communication, which should resolve the output capturing issues.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Conduct the final, definitive, full-system end-to-end test.
*   **Purpose:** To verify that all bugs are resolved and that a user in the VS Code UI can successfully create and recall a memory.
