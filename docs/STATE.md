# mem0 Project State

This document tracks the current state of our development work. It serves as a short-term memory to ensure continuity across sessions and conversation contexts.

### Last Action Completed:

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T13:20:00Z
*   **Action:** Pivoted the project strategy after a series of UI development failures.
*   **Details:** We have abandoned the `vscode-client` for now. The new strategy is for the agent (me) to be the primary user of the `mem0` CLI tool. I successfully demonstrated this new workflow by starting the server, remembering our project vision, and recalling it.

### Next Action Planned:

*   **Action:** Enhance the `remember` command in the CLI.
*   **Purpose:** To make the tool more powerful for our workflow by allowing it to remember the contents of a file or the output of another command directly (e.g., `mem0 remember --file schema.sql` or `mem0 remember --command "git log -n 1"`).
