# Follow-up Patch v1

Delivers:
1) Strict JWT verifier enforcing aud/iss allowlists and bounded clock skew.
2) Multipart per-part limits and PE/PDF/PNG header detection helper.
3) Metrics label guard to bound cardinality (route template & reason buckets).
4) Policy snapshot pre-commit gate to prevent unnoticed RBAC drift.

See tests/ for usage examples.
