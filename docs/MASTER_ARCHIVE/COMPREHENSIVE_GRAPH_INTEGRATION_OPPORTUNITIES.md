## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### **Graph Service HTTP Integration Pattern**
```python
class GraphServiceClient:
    async def enhance_memory_suggestions(self, memory_id: str) -> Optional[List[dict]]:
        try:
            response = await self.http_client.post(
                f"{self.graph_service_url}/graph/memory/{memory_id}/related",
                timeout=2.0  # Fast timeout for optional enhancement
            )
            return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None
        except (TimeoutError, ConnectionError):
            return None  # Graceful degradation

    async def analyze_tenant_networks(self, tenant_id: str) -> Optional[dict]:
        try:
            response = await self.http_client.get(
                f"{self.graph_service_url}/graph/tenant/{tenant_id}/networks",
                timeout=5.0  # Longer timeout for analytics
            )
            return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None
        except Exception:
            return {"error": "Graph analytics unavailable"}
```

### **Graceful Degradation Examples**
```python
# Memory Suggestions with Graph Enhancement
async def get_enhanced_suggestions(memory_id: str):
    # Always get standard suggestions
    standard_suggestions = await get_standard_suggestions(memory_id)

    # Try to enhance with graph
    graph_suggestions = await graph_client.enhance_suggestions(memory_id)

    if graph_suggestions:
        return merge_suggestions(standard_suggestions, graph_suggestions)
    else:
        return standard_suggestions  # Graceful fallback

# Vendor Admin with Graph Analytics
async def get_tenant_insights(tenant_id: str):
    basic_insights = await get_basic_tenant_metrics(tenant_id)

    graph_insights = await graph_client.analyze_tenant_networks(tenant_id)

    return {
        **basic_insights,
        "graph_analytics": graph_insights or {"status": "unavailable"}
    }
