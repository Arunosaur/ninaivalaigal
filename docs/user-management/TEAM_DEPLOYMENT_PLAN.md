# mem0 Team Deployment Plan

## Current Architecture (Enterprise-Ready)

### ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION** (2025-09-10)
- **FastAPI server** (port 13370) with complete JWT authentication and sharing
- **PostgreSQL database** fully active with multi-user support and sharing models
- **MCP server** (stdio) for AI tools with comprehensive tool support
- **Multi-level sharing**: Personal → Team → Organization → Public
- **Role-based permissions**: Owner/Admin/Member/Viewer with inheritance
- **Organization management**: Full org/team/user hierarchy
- **Cross-platform support**: Linux/Unix, Windows, macOS, all major shells
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time metrics and health checks
- **Enhanced AI integrations**: OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub Copilot support

## Team Deployment Options

### ✅ **IMPLEMENTED: Enterprise-Ready Architecture**
```
Team Members → Shared FastAPI Server (with complete auth & sharing)
            → Local MCP Servers (stdio, for AI tools)
            → Shared PostgreSQL Database (multi-user, sharing models)
            → Universal Shell Integration (cross-platform)
```

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Complete JWT Authentication**: User registration, login, token management
- ✅ **Multi-Level Sharing**: Personal, Team, Organization, Public contexts
- ✅ **Role-Based Permissions**: Owner/Admin/Member/Viewer with inheritance
- ✅ **Organization Management**: Full org/team/user hierarchy support
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Clients**: CLI, shell integration, VS Code extension
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and health checks
- ✅ **AI Tool Integrations**: OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub Copilot support

### Legacy Options (For Reference)

#### Option A: Centralized MCP + FastAPI
```
Team Members → Centralized FastAPI Server (with auth)
             → Centralized MCP HTTP Server (with auth)
             → Shared PostgreSQL Database
```

#### Option B: Hybrid Architecture (Previously Recommended)
```
Team Members → Individual MCP servers (stdio, local AI tools)
             → Shared FastAPI Server (with auth)
             → Shared PostgreSQL Database
```

## Security Implementation Plan

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Enterprise-Grade Security**
- **JWT Authentication**: Complete token-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **User Isolation**: Cryptographic separation of user data preventing cross-user access
- **Multi-Level Authorization**: Role-based permissions with hierarchical inheritance
- **API Security**: Secure endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of sharing activities and permission changes

### Phase 1: Authentication ✅ COMPLETE
- JWT token-based authentication ✅
- User registration/login endpoints ✅
- API key generation for programmatic access ✅

### Phase 2: Authorization ✅ COMPLETE
- User-scoped database queries ✅
- Context ownership and sharing permissions ✅
- Team-based access controls ✅
- Organization-level permissions ✅

### Phase 3: Deployment Security ✅ COMPLETE
- HTTPS/TLS ready for production deployment
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for team usage
- Secure configuration management

## Migration Steps ✅ COMPLETE

1. **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL fully active with multi-user support ✅
2. **Authentication Layer**: Complete JWT auth implementation ✅
3. **Client Updates**: Full CLI/shell authentication support ✅
4. **Team Deployment**: Enterprise-ready deployment architecture ✅
5. **MCP Evolution**: Hybrid architecture with local/remote MCP support ✅

## Timeline Estimate ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 1 (Auth)**: ✅ COMPLETED (JWT authentication fully implemented)
- **Phase 2 (Authorization)**: ✅ COMPLETED (Multi-level sharing and permissions)
- **Phase 3 (Deployment)**: ✅ COMPLETED (Enterprise-ready architecture)
- **Total**: ✅ **ALL PHASES COMPLETED** - Ready for production deployment

## Deployment Scenarios

### Small Team (2-10 developers)
```
Recommended Setup:
- Single shared mem0 server (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- Docker Compose deployment for simplicity
- Local MCP servers on developer machines
- Shared contexts for project collaboration
```

### Medium Team (10-50 developers)
```
Recommended Setup:
- Dedicated mem0 server (VM/Cloud instance)
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- Load balancer for high availability
- Organization structure with multiple teams
- Performance monitoring and alerting
```

### Large Organization (50+ developers)
```
Enterprise Setup:
- Multi-server deployment (horizontal scaling)
- PostgreSQL cluster with replication
- Advanced monitoring and analytics
- SSO integration (LDAP, SAML, OAuth)
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Cross-organization collaboration support
```

## Compatibility Notes
- Current individual setup remains fully functional
- Team deployment is additive, not replacement
- Users can choose individual vs team mode
- MCP servers can coexist (local + remote)
