## Next Action Planned:

**Action:** Implement Centralized Redaction Module (Spec 008 - Phase 1)
**Purpose:** Build enterprise-grade security middleware with intelligent redaction capabilities
**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create server/security/ module structure with redaction components
2. Implement entropy-based secret detection with configurable thresholds
3. Build context-aware pattern detection for provider-specific secrets
4. Add redaction processors with tier-appropriate rules
5. Create comprehensive audit trail for all redaction events
6. Integrate with existing RBAC system for context sensitivity enforcement
