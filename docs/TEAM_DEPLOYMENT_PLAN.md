# mem0 Team Deployment Plan

## Current Architecture (Individual Use)
- FastAPI server (port 13370) for CLI/shell/VS Code clients
- MCP server (stdio) for AI tools like Claude Desktop
- **SQLite database** for local storage (despite PostgreSQL being configured)
- Database schema ready for multi-user (user_id columns exist)
- No authentication required

## Team Deployment Options

### Option A: Centralized MCP + FastAPI
```
Team Members → Centralized FastAPI Server (with auth)
             → Centralized MCP HTTP Server (with auth)
             → Shared PostgreSQL Database
```

**Pros:**
- Single source of truth for all memories
- Centralized management and backup
- Cross-team context sharing possible

**Cons:**
- More complex security implementation
- Network dependency for all operations
- Potential performance bottleneck

### Option B: Hybrid Architecture (Recommended)
```
Team Members → Individual MCP servers (stdio, local AI tools)
             → Shared FastAPI Server (with auth)
             → Shared PostgreSQL Database
```

**Pros:**
- AI tools remain fast (local MCP)
- Shared memory storage for team collaboration
- Simpler security model (only FastAPI needs auth)
- Gradual migration path

**Cons:**
- Dual management (local MCP + remote FastAPI)

## Security Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication
- JWT token-based authentication
- User registration/login endpoints
- API key generation for programmatic access

### Phase 2: Authorization
- User-scoped database queries
- Context ownership and sharing permissions
- Team-based access controls

### Phase 3: Deployment Security
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for team usage

## Migration Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Set up PostgreSQL locally/Docker (schema ready, need connection)
2. **Authentication Layer**: Add JWT auth to FastAPI endpoints
3. **Client Updates**: Update CLI/shell to handle authentication
4. **Team Deployment**: Deploy to shared server with proper security
5. **MCP Evolution**: Evaluate centralized vs hybrid MCP approach

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1 (Auth)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Authorization)**: 1 week  
- **Phase 3 (Deployment)**: 1 week
- **Total**: 3-4 weeks for full team deployment

## Compatibility Notes
- Current individual setup remains fully functional
- Team deployment is additive, not replacement
- Users can choose individual vs team mode
- MCP servers can coexist (local + remote)
