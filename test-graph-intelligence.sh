# Graph intelligence benefits
echo "🧠 Step 4: Graph Intelligence Benefits"
echo "======================================"
echo ""
echo "This structure enables powerful graph operations:"
echo ""
echo "🔍 Graph Traversal:"
echo "  - Find all memories in a context"
echo "  - Discover related contexts through shared memories"
echo "  - Trace decision paths and dependencies"
echo ""
echo "📊 Graph Analytics:"
echo "  - Identify central/important memories (high degree)"
echo "  - Find knowledge clusters and communities"
echo "  - Measure context relevance and memory importance"
echo ""
echo "🤖 AI-Ready Structure:"
echo "  - Graph neural networks can process this directly"
echo "  - Semantic similarity through graph embeddings"
echo "  - Recommendation engines using graph traversal"
echo ""
echo "🔗 Relationship Types:"
echo "  - belongs_to: Memory is part of context"
echo "  - decision_in: Memory represents decision made in context"
echo "  - discussed_in: Memory was discussed in context"
echo "  - review_of: Memory is review/feedback on context"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Step 5: Graph Intelligence Use Cases"
echo "======================================="
echo ""
echo "Now you can build:"
echo ""
echo "📈 Knowledge Discovery:"
echo "  - 'Show me all decisions related to authentication'"

echo "  - 'What contexts are most active?'"
echo ""
echo "🔄 Workflow Intelligence:"
echo "  - 'What decisions led to this outcome?'"
echo "  - 'Which team members contribute to which contexts?'"
echo "  - 'How do our contexts relate to each other?'"
echo ""
echo "🎨 Visualization Ready:"
echo "  - D3.js force-directed graphs"
echo "  - Cytoscape.js network visualization"
echo "  - Interactive graph exploration"
echo ""
echo "🤖 AI Integration:"
