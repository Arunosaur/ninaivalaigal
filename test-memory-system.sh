echo "🎨 Step 6: Frontend Integration Points"
echo "====================================="
echo ""
echo "Memory system integrates perfectly with your existing auth and teams:"
echo ""
echo "🔐 Authentication:"
echo "  - All endpoints require JWT tokens"
echo "  - User context automatically applied"
echo ""
echo "👥 Team Integration:"
echo "  - Memories can be scoped to teams"
echo "  - Team membership controls access"
echo "  - Role-based permissions enforced"
echo ""
echo "🏷️ Rich Metadata:"
echo "  - Tagging system for organization"
echo "  - Search across content and tags"
echo "  - Statistics and analytics"
echo ""
echo "📱 Mobile/Web Ready:"
echo "  - GET-based API works everywhere"
echo "  - JSON responses for easy parsing"
echo "  - Filtering and pagination support"
echo ""

echo "✅ Memory System Ready!"
echo "======================"
echo ""
echo "🎉 Features Available:"
echo "  ✅ Personal memory storage"
echo "  ✅ Team-scoped memory sharing"
echo "  ✅ Advanced search and filtering"
echo "  ✅ Tag-based organization"
echo "  ✅ Access control and permissions"
echo "  ✅ Memory statistics and analytics"
echo ""
echo "🔗 Integration Benefits:"
echo "  🧠 Core Ninaivalaigal functionality unlocked"
echo "  👥 Seamless team collaboration"
echo "  🔐 Secure, role-based access"
echo "  🎨 Frontend-ready API design"
echo "  📊 Rich metadata and search"
echo ""
echo "📚 Next Steps:"
echo "  1. Build frontend memory interface"
echo "  2. Add structured memory types (URLs, files, etc.)"
echo "  3. Implement memory sharing and permissions"
echo "  4. Add memory analytics and insights"
